## CS 344 - Artificial Intelligence

This is sample code for
[CS 344 at Calvin College](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/344/kvlinden).
For details, see the
[course schedule](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/336/kvlinden/schedule.html).

The tools directory includes the
[Python 3 AIMA repo](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python)
and code from the [PAIP repo](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp).
It also includes a `packages.txt` that specifies the packages required
to build a Python virtual environment for the course code.

### Getting Started

To use this code, do the following:
1. Clone this `cs344-code` quick-start repo to your local machine.
2. Create your own CS 344 code repo on GitHub:
`https://github.com/`***GITHUB_ID***`/cs344` and clone it to your local
machine.
3. Build/Use a Python virtual environment using `packages.txt`.

You will generally work with with your own `cs344` repo, using copies of
code from our `cs344-code` as needed. Check our repo periodically
so that you can pull/merge any changes.
